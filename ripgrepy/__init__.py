        """
        Enabling this flag will cause ripgrep to search binary files. By
        default, ripgrep attempts to automatically skip binary files in
        order to improve the relevance of results and make the search
        faster.

        Binary files are heuristically detected based on whether they
        contain a NUL byte or not. By default (without this flag set), once
        a NUL byte is seen, ripgrep will stop searching the file. Usually,
        NUL bytes occur in the beginning of most binary files. If a NUL
        byte occurs after a match, then ripgrep will still stop searching
        the rest of the file, but a warning will be printed.

        In contrast, when this flag is provided, ripgrep will continue
        searching a file even if a NUL byte is found. In particular, if a
        NUL byte is found then ripgrep will continue searching until either
        a match is found or the end of the file is reached, whichever comes
        sooner. If a match is found, then ripgrep will stop and print a
        warning saying that the search stopped prematurely.

        If you want ripgrep to search a file without any special NUL byte
        handling at all (and potentially print binary data to stdout), then
        you should use the -a/--text flag.

        The --binary flag is a flag for controlling ripgrep's automatic
        filtering mechanism. As such, it does not need to be used when
        searching a file explicitly or when searching stdin. That is, it is
        only applicable when recursively searching a directory.

        Note that when the -u/--unrestricted flag is provided for a third
        time, then this flag is automatically enabled.

        This flag can be disabled with --no-binary. It overrides the
        -a/--text flag.

    def auto_hybrid_regex(self) -> Ripgrepy:
        """
        When this flag is used, ripgrep will dynamically choose between
        supported regex engines depending on the features used in a
        pattern. When ripgrep chooses a regex engine, it applies that
        choice for every regex provided to ripgrep (e.g., via multiple
        -e/--regexp or -f/--file flags).

        As an example of how this flag might behave, ripgrep will attempt
        to use its default finite automata based regex engine whenever the
        pattern can be successfully compiled with that regex engine. If
        PCRE2 is enabled and if the pattern given could not be compiled
        with the default regex engine, then PCRE2 will be automatically
        used for searching. If PCRE2 isn't available, then this flag has no
        effect because there is only one regex engine to choose from.

        In the future, ripgrep may adjust its heuristics for how it decides
        which regex engine to use. In general, the heuristics will be
        limited to a static analysis of the patterns, and not to any
        specific runtime behavior observed while searching files.

        The primary downside of using this flag is that it may not always
        be obvious which regex engine ripgrep uses, and thus, the match
        semantics or performance profile of ripgrep may subtly and
        unexpectedly change. However, in many cases, all regex engines will
        agree on what constitutes a match and it can be nice to
        transparently support more advanced regex features like look-around
        and backreferences without explicitly needing to enable them.

        certain size. This is the default when ripgrep's stdout is
        redirected to a pipeline or a file. When ripgrep's stdout is
        connected to a terminal, line buffering will be used. Forcing block
        buffering can be useful when dumping a large amount of contents to
        a terminal.

        Forceful block buffering can be disabled with --no-block-buffered.

        Enable matching across multiple lines.

        When multiline mode is enabled, ripgrep will lift the restriction
        that a match cannot include a line terminator. For example, when
        multiline mode is not enabled (the default), then the regex `\\p{any}`
        will match any Unicode codepoint other than \\n. Similarly, the
        regex \\n is explicitly forbidden, and if you try to use it, ripgrep
        will return an error. However, when multiline mode is enabled,
        `\\p{any}` will match any Unicode codepoint, including \\n, and regexes
        like \\n are permitted.

        An important caveat is that multiline mode does not change the
        match semantics of .. Namely, in most regex matchers, a .  will by
        default match any character other than \\n, and this is true in
        ripgrep as well. In order to make .  match \\n, you must enable the
        "dot all" flag inside the regex. For example, both (?s).  and
        (?s:.)  have the same semantics, where .  will match any character,
        including \\n. Alternatively, the --multiline-dotall flag may be
        passed to make the "dot all" behavior the default. This flag only
        applies when multiline search is enabled.

        There is no limit on the number of the lines that a single match
        can span.

        WARNING: Because of how the underlying regex engine works,
        multiline searches may be slower than normal line-oriented
        searches, and they may also use more memory. In particular, when
        multiline mode is enabled, ripgrep requires that each file it
        searches is laid out contiguously in memory (either by reading it
        onto the heap or by memory-mapping it). Things that cannot be
        memory-mapped (such as stdin) will be consumed until EOF before
        searching can begin. In general, ripgrep will only do these things
        when necessary. Specifically, if the --multiline flag is provided
        but the regex does not contain patterns that would match \\n
        characters, then ripgrep will automatically avoid reading each file
        into memory before searching it. Nevertheless, if you only care
        about matches spanning at most one line, then it is always better
        to disable multiline mode.

        Normally, a .  will match any character except newlines. While this

        When PCRE2 matching is enabled, this flag will disable Unicode
        mode, which is otherwise enabled by default. If PCRE2 matching is
        not enabled, then this flag has no effect.

        When PCRE2's Unicode mode is enabled, several different types of
        patterns become Unicode aware. This includes \\b, \\B, \\w, \\W, \\d,
        \\D, \\s and \\S. Similarly, the .  meta character will match any
        Unicode codepoint instead of any byte. Caseless matching will also
        use Unicode simple case folding instead of ASCII-only case
        insensitivity.

        Unicode mode in PCRE2 represents a critical trade off in the user
        experience of ripgrep. In particular, unlike the default regex
        engine, PCRE2 does not support the ability to search possibly
        invalid UTF-8 with Unicode features enabled. Instead, PCRE2
        requires that everything it searches when Unicode mode is enabled
        is valid UTF-8. (Or valid UTF-16/UTF-32, but for the purposes of
        ripgrep, we only discuss UTF-8.) This means that if you have
        PCRE2's Unicode mode enabled and you attempt to search invalid
        UTF-8, then the search for that file will halt and print an error.
        For this reason, when PCRE2's Unicode mode is enabled, ripgrep will
        automatically "fix" invalid UTF-8 sequences by replacing them with
        the Unicode replacement codepoint.

        If you would rather see the encoding errors surfaced by PCRE2 when
        Unicode mode is enabled, then pass the --no-encoding flag to
        disable all transcoding.

        For each input FILE, search the standard output of COMMAND FILE
        rather than the contents of FILE. This option expects the COMMAND
        program to either be an absolute path or to be available in your
        PATH. Either an empty string COMMAND or the --no-pre flag will
        disable this behavior.

        WARNING: When this flag is set, ripgrep will unconditionally spawn a
        process for every file that is searched. Therefore, this can incur an
        unnecessarily large performance penalty if you don't otherwise need the
        flexibility offered by this flag. One possible mitigation to this is to use
        the '--pre-glob' flag to limit which files a preprocessor is run with.

        A preprocessor is not run when ripgrep is searching stdin.

        When searching over sets of files that may require one of several
        decoders as preprocessors, COMMAND should be a wrapper program or
        script which first classifies FILE based on magic numbers/content
        or based on the FILE name and then dispatches to an appropriate
        preprocessor. Each COMMAND also has its standard input connected to
        FILE for convenience.

        For example, a shell script for COMMAND might look like:

        >>>    case "$1" in
        >>>    *.pdf)
        >>>        exec pdftotext "$1" -
        >>>        ;;
        >>>    *)
        >>>        case $(file "$1") in
        >>>        *Zstandard*)
        >>>            exec pzstd -cdq
        >>>            ;;
        >>>        *)
        >>>            exec cat
        >>>            ;;
        >>>        esac
        >>>        ;;
        >>>    esac

        The above script uses pdftotext to convert a PDF file to plain
        text. For all other files, the script uses the file utility to
        sniff the type of the file based on its contents. If it is a
        compressed file in the Zstandard format, then pzstd is used to
        decompress the contents to stdout.

        This overrides the -z/--search-zip flag.

        This flag is useful when searching many files with the --pre flag.
        Namely, it permits the ability to avoid process overhead for files

    ### Options for version 12 of ripgrep
    @_logger
    def no_unicode(self) -> Ripgrepy:
        """
        By default, ripgrep will enable "Unicode mode" in all of its
        regexes. This has a number of consequences:

        ·   . will only match valid UTF-8 encoded scalar values.

        ·   Classes like \\w, \\s, \\d are all Unicode aware and much bigger
            than their ASCII only versions.

        ·   Case insensitive matching will use Unicode case folding.

        ·   A large array of classes like \p{Emoji} are available.

        ·   Word boundaries (\\b and \\B) use the Unicode definition of a
            word character.

            In some cases it can be desirable to turn these things off. The
            --no-unicode flag will do exactly that.

            For PCRE2 specifically, Unicode mode represents a critical
            trade off in the user experience of ripgrep. In particular,
            unlike the default regex engine, PCRE2 does not support the
            ability to search possibly invalid UTF-8 with Unicode features
            enabled. Instead, PCRE2 requires that everything it searches
            when Unicode mode is enabled is valid UTF-8. (Or valid
            UTF-16/UTF-32, but for the purposes of ripgrep, we only discuss
            UTF-8.) This means that if you have PCRE2's Unicode mode
            enabled and you attempt to search invalid UTF-8, then the
            search for that file will halt and print an error. For this
            reason, when PCRE2's Unicode mode is enabled, ripgrep will
            automatically "fix" invalid UTF-8 sequences by replacing them
            with the Unicode replacement codepoint. This penalty does not
            occur when using the default regex engine.

            If you would rather see the encoding errors surfaced by PCRE2
            when Unicode mode is enabled, then pass the --no-encoding flag
            to disable all transcoding.

            The --no-unicode flag can be disabled with --unicode. Note that
            --no-pcre2-unicode and --pcre2-unicode are aliases for
            --no-unicode and --unicode, respectively.

        Accepted values are default, pcre2, or auto.

        The default value is default, which is the fastest and should be
        good for most use cases. The pcre2 engine is generally useful when
        you want to use features such as look-around or backreferences.
